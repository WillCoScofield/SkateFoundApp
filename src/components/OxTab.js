        A sleep study is needed early in the life of a child with T21.

        Sleep apnea has an effect on a child’s cognitive ability, behavior,
        growth rate, and heart issues. Since children with T21 are more likely
        to have heart problems from birth and are more likely to have sleep
        apnea, this combination can lead to severe complications. Unfortunately,
        it is very difficult for parents to accurately determine sleep
        abnormalities in their children with T21. Professor Sally Shot, MD
        conducted clinical studies which successfully led to the American
        Academy of Pediatrics to lower recommendations for earlier testing for
        sleep apnea to age three. Although a huge achievement, it has been
        proven to appear in as early as the first few months of life. This,
        coupled with the critical brain development which occurs in the first
        three years Families and cares are strongly urged to begin testing and
        to continue testing and overnight sleep studies from six months onward.
        A parent should have a short checklist with them when asking their
        pediatrician to prescribe sleep studies:

        Over 80% + of Children with T21 test positive for sleep apnea over all.
        Included in this statistic is an alarming percentage of infants and
        toddlers.

        Brain development between birth and three years of age is unanimously
        agreed as the most crucial in a human life. If a child suffers sleep
        apnea during this critical time, their brain is starved of oxygen
        hundreds of times during a regular night’s sleep, hence hindering normal
        healthy brain development.

        Most families place their faith in the advice of their pediatrician. The
        country’s pediatrics governing body has not yet advised testing to begin
        early enough. Therefore families are usually told that the test is
        probably not necessary.

      <Text>
        A large percentage of small children with T21 are unable to snore. And
        without audible snoring, tossing and turning, or other extremely
        restless symptoms sleep apnea is virtually undetectable without a fully
        excluded sleep study in a sleep clinic. With or without symptoms the
        condition can exist and accelerate cognitive delay.
